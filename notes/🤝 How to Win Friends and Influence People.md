## Don't criticize, condemn, or complain
Humans naturally think good of themselves, and because of this, criticism is futile. It only puts the target on the defensive, yearning to defend or justify themself. It rarely persuades someone of their wrongdoing.

As repeated again and again in history, encouragement is much more effective than rebuke. It is only through kind words and understanding can we change someone's mind, even if the fault is entirely their own.

## Give honest and sincere appreciation
The only way to get someone to do something is to make the other person want to do it, and the only way to do this is to give them what they want. One of these things—perhaps the most important—is the desire to be important.

The way successful people feed this craving is simply through appreciation. As Schwab said, "I am hearty in my approbation and and lavish in my praise." Sincere appreciation (unlike insincere flattery), stoked by genuine interest in other people, goes a long way in setting small flames of friendship ablaze; people will cherish these words for a lifetime.
