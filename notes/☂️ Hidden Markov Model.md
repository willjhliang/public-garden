# Theory
Hidden Markov Models use the Markov property, which states that each variable conditionally depends only on the variable right before it in the sequence.
$$p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = p(x_1)p(x_2|x_1)p(x_3|x_2)p(x_4|x_3)$$
We exploit this assumption to translate an input sequence to another sequence using a Markov matrix or graph that models probabilistic transitions across variables. The graph consists of hidden states and observable variables in the structure below; note that this structure is similar to [[‚õìÔ∏è Markov Chain]] with observable variables tacked onto the original states.

Each hidden state gives emissions with certain probabilities and transition to another hidden state with another set of probabilities. The input sequence we get is the observable variables $Y$, and for translation, our goal is to find the most probable sequence $X$ that generated these emissions.

To predict the probability of sequence $X$ given another sequence $Y$, we use [[Y) = \arg\max_X \frac{P(Y|X)P(X)}{P(Y)} = \arg\max_X \prod_{i=1}^m P(y_i|x_i) P(x_i|x_{i-1})$$

For example, for speech recognition (predicting words from sounds), we start with a prior of the likelihood of each word along with likelihood of each sound given a word.

# Model
Our model consists of hidden states $X$, transition probabilities $p(x_i|x_j) = A_{ij}$ in the Markov transition matrix, and observation emission for each state $p(y_j | x_i) = B_{ij}$.

We also track an initial state distribution, $p(x_i) = \pi_i$ to determine which state to start in.

# Training
Given training data $D$, we maximize $P(D|\lambda)$ for parameters $\lambda = (A, B, \pi)$ using [[üéâ Expectation Maximization]].

# Prediction
There are two main types of problems with HMMs.
1. Evaluation: given observations $Y$ and $\lambda = (A, B, \pi)$, compute probability of $Y$ occurring.
2. Decoding: given observations $Y$ and $\lambda = (A, B, \pi)$, find the state sequence $X$ that best explains $Y$; in other words, find the sequence that has highest probability of generating $Y$ using the Bayes' rule equation above.
