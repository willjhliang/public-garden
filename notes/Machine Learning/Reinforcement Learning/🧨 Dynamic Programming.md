# 🧨 Dynamic Programming

# Theory
Dynamic programming trains a [🌎 Markov Decision Process](/public-garden/notes/Machine Learning/Reinforcement Learning/🌎 Markov Decision Process.html) using Bellman's equation 

\[

V_{\pi}(s) = \sum_a \pi(a \vert s) \sum_{s', r} p(s', r \vert s, a)[r + \gamma V_\pi(s')]

\]

 for policy iteration optimization and Bellman's optimality equation 

\[

V_*(s) = \max_a \sum_{s', r} p(s', r \vert s, a)[r + \gamma V_*(s')]

\]

 for value iteration optimization.

## Model
We're given the MDP model, and dynamic programming can use policy or value iteration to find the optimal policy. We maintain the policy \(\pi\) and value function \(V_\pi(s)\).

## Training
Both policy and value iteration can find the optimal policy.

### Policy Iteration
Initialize value \(V(s)\) and policy \(\pi(s)\) arbitrarily. Then, we'll alternate between policy evaluation and improvement until the policy stops changing.

For policy evaluation, repeat the following until convergence.
1. For each state \(s\), update 

\[

V(s) = \sum_{s', r} p(s', r \vert s, \pi(s))[r + \gamma V(s')]

\]

For policy improvement, go through each state \(s\),
1. Update 

\[

\pi(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s', r} p(s', r \vert s, a)[r + \gamma V(s')]

\]

### Value Iteration
Instead of alternating between updating policies and values, we'll optimize values first and then derive a policy from it.

First, initialize value \(V(s)\) arbitrarily. Then, repeat until convergence.
1. For each state \(s\), update 

\[

V(s) = \max_a\sum_{s', r} p(s', r \vert s, a)[r + \gamma V(s')]

\]

Then, our policy is defined like above, 

\[

\pi(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s', r} p(s', r\vert s, a) [r + \gamma V(s')]

\]

## Prediction
With a trained policy, we simply act following it, performing \(\pi(s)\) when we're at state \(s\)
