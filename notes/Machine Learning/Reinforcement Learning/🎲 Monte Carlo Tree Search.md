# 🎲 Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Theory
Monte Carlo Tree Search is a model-free method that evaluates and improves a policy by directly sampling (playing) the environment through multiple episodes. In other words, our statistics are empirical.
1. $$V_\pi(s)$$ is the average of returns $$G$$ following all visits to $$s$$ in our episodes.
2. $$Q_\pi(s, a)$$ is the average of returns $$G$$ following all visits to $$(s, a)$$ in our episodes.

Like other methods, it alternates between evaluation and improvement.

We generally use [🧧 Epsilon-Greedy](/public-garden/notes/Machine Learning/Reinforcement Learning/🧧 Epsilon-Greedy.html) off-policy play, exploring on our first move and exploiting the rest. However, there are better ways to choose random moves. Below are some ways to “rank” the non-greedy moves, and we pick the best.
1. Low visit count.
2. High move probability under policy $$\pi$$.
3. High value based on a neural network.

This optimization strategy is especially effective with self-play. In each episode, we let the opponent also play using the policy and evaluate the value of the policy playing against itself.

## Model
Our model includes the policy $$\pi$$ and the value or q-value functions $$V_\pi(s)$$ and $$Q_{\pi}(s, a)$$.

## Training
Policy learning alternatives between evaluation and improvement until the policy stops changing.

To evaluate a policy $$\pi$$, first initialize $$V(s)$$ arbitrarily, and let $$Returns(s)$$ be an empty list. Then, loop for $$M$$ episodes.
1. Generate an episode by acting with $$\pi$$ until termination.
2. Initialize $$G = 0$$.
3. Go backwards through the episode's steps, $$t = T-1, \ldots, 0$$.
	1. Update $$G = \gamma G + R_{t+1}$$, essentially calculating the long-term reward for the current state $$S_t$$.
	2. If $$S_t$$ does not appear again in a previous step (this is the earliest point in our episode where we see $$S_t$$), add $$G$$ to $$Returns(S_t)$$ and update 

$$

V(S_t) = \text{average}(Returns(S_t))

$$

The above algorithm can also be modified to record actions as well, which allows us to also calculate $$Q(S_t, A_t)$$.

Our new policy will greedily take the best action for each state, 

$$

\pi(S_t) = \arg\max_a Q(S_t, a)

$$
