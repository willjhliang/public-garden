# 🚒 Response Surface Methods

# Theory
Response surface methods is a bit different from other reinforcement learning ideas in that it tackles loss minimization from an [✋ Active Learning](/public-garden/notes/Machine Learning/Supervised Learning/✋ Active Learning.html) point of view. Our goal is to find some \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(y\\) (for unknown function \\(y = f(x)\\)), and to do so, we repeatedly query \\(x_t\\) and improve our guess for \\(f\\).

Unlike active learning, our goal is to minimize \\(y\\) instead of fitting to the entire data. This makes the problem much more like reinforcement learning, specifically [🎰 Contextual Bandit](/public-garden/notes/Machine Learning/Reinforcement Learning/🎰 Contextual Bandit.html), where \\(x\\) corresponds with an action and \\(f(x)\\) is the reward (or loss, in our minimization case).

## Training
Given a set of datapoints \\((X, y)\\), fit a model \\(y = f(x; \theta)\\), known as the response surface (analogous to model of the world). Then, repeat the following.
1. Pick the next \\(x_t\\) using gradient descent on \\(f\\). This is similar to the exploitation step in standard reinforcement learning.
2. Measure the corresponding \\(y_t\\), then use \\((x_t, y_t)\\) to update \\(f(x; \theta)\\)
