# 🧧 Epsilon-Greedy

$$\epsilon$$-greedy is a simple policy derived from $$Q(s, a)$$ values. Unlike a standard greedy policy that always takes the action that maximizes $$Q$$, $$\epsilon$$-greedy also encourages exploration by occasionally choosing random actions.

Specifically, the policy is as follows.

$$

\pi(s) = \begin{cases} \text{random action} & \text{with probability $\epsilon$} \\ \arg\max_a Q(s,a) & \text{with probability $1-\epsilon$}\end{cases}

$$

$$\epsilon$$ is the hyperparameter that balances exploration and exploitation. Higher $$\epsilon$$ means more exploration, less exploitation.
