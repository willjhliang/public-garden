# ⛓️ Markov Chain

## Theory
The Markov property states that the future only depends on the present. Markov chains use this property to model dynamic systems that transition between states; the next state depends only on the current state.

## Model
A chain consists of a set of states, probabilities of initializing at each state, and a matrix of transition probabilities across states. The following is a graphical example.
