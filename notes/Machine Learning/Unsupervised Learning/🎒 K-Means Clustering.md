# 🎒 K-Means Clustering

## Theory
Grouping datapoints into clusters can give us important information about the data; each cluster is defined by a centroid value.

K-Means is a clustering algorithm that uses EM to iteratively optimize its groupings. In this case, our hidden state is the cluster assignment of each point.

We implicitly minimize the loss function 

$$

J(\mu, r) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} \Vert \mu_k - x_i\Vert_2^2

$$

where $$r_{ik} = 1$$ when $$x_i$$ belongs in cluster $$k$$; in other words, we minimize the distance between each point and the centroid of the cluster it belongs to. This can also be interpreted as reconstruction loss if we approximate points by their centroid.

E-step finds the best $$r_{ik}$$ for each point, assigning each point to its closest centroid. M-step finds the best $$\mu_k$$ for each cluster, recalculating the centroid to be the average of the cluster’s points.

## Model
K-Means tracks the $$k$$ centroids of the clusters; cluster assignment can be calculated for each point by finding its closest centroid.

## Training
Given training data $$D$$, pick $$k$$ centroids at random, usually points from $$D$$ that are spread out.

Alternate until convergence.
1. Assign each point to its nearest centroid.
2. Recalculate each centroid to be the mean of its assigned points.

## Prediction
Given point $$x$$, its cluster assignment is the centroid $$\mu_k$$ closest to $$x$$.
