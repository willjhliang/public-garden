# 💯 Evaluation

Classification performance has multiple metrics, many used in case the classes are asymmetric, with one class having more examples than the others.

Accuracy is the main symmetric measure.

\[

\text{accuracy} = p(\text{correct}) = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN}

\]

Asymmetric measures include precision, recall (sensitivity or true positive rate), and specificity (inverse of false positive rate).

\[

\text{precision} = p(\text{yes } \vert \text{ predicted yes}) = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}

\]

\[

\text{recall} = p(\text{predicted yes } \vert \text{ yes}) = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}

\]

\[

\text{specificity} = p(\text{predicted no } \vert \text{ no}) = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}

\]

F1 score combines precision and recall.

\[

F1 = \frac{2 * \text{precision} * \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}

\]

The ROC curve, pictured below, sorts predictions in descending order of confidence and measures sensitivity, the true positive rate, over a confidence threshold. As threshold increases, we predict more “yes,” so sensitivity increases.

> The threshold can also be interpreted as \(1 - \text{specificity}\), or the false positive rate.

The stronger the curve, the better the performance. Thus, area under curve (AUC) is another common metric for performance, varying between \(0.5\) (random) and \(1\) (perfect).

Finally, a confusion matrix shows counts of actual vs predicted class values.
