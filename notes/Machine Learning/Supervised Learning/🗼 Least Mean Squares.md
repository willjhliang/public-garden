# 🗼 Least Mean Squares

## Theory
LMS is an online learning (streaming) alternative to [💰 Linear Regression](/public-garden/notes/Machine Learning/Supervised Learning/💰 Linear Regression.html); the closed form calculation can be extremely expensive, so LMS approximates it.

As before, we optimize the $$L_2$$ loss, but this time with stochastic [⛰️ Gradient Descent](/public-garden/notes/Machine Learning/Optimization/⛰️ Gradient Descent.html).

> For learning rate $$\eta$$, LMS converges if $$0 < \eta < \lambda_{max}$$ where $$\lambda_{max}$$ is the largest value of covariance matrix $$X^TX$$.

### Locally Weighted Regression
If our data is non-linear, we can approximate a prediction by fitting a line to points that are nearby. However, this is a non-parametric method that requires fitting a new line for every prediction.

Specifically, we aim to find $$\theta$$ that minimizes the weighted $$L_2$$ loss 

$$

\sum_{i=1}^n w^{(i)} (y^{(i)} - \theta^Tx^{(i)})^2

$$

where $$w^{(i)} = \exp\{\frac{-(x^{(i)} - x)^2}{2\tau^2}\}$$, $$\tau$$ controlling the bandwidth of the sudo-gaussian.

## Model
The model itself is the exact same as linear regression: we keep a set of weights $$\theta$$ that are applied to each feature in the input $$x$$. We also maintain learning rate $$\eta$$ as a hyperparameter used during training.

## Training
Given training data $$D$$, initialize weights $$\theta$$ randomly.

Then, go through each observation $$x_i$$ sequentially,
1. Let residual $$r_i = y_i - \theta^Tx_i$$
2. Update weights $$\theta = \theta + \eta r_i x_i$$

> To derive the update step, we observe that the derivative of L2 loss is $$-2r_ix_i$$, so a move in the gradient step with scaling $$\frac{\eta}{2}$$ gives us our update equation.

## Prediction
Similar to linear regression, given input $$x$$, our prediction $$\hat{y} = \theta^Tx$$.
