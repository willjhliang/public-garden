# 👓 Perceptron

## Theory
Perceptrons are an online learning alternative to the [🛩️ Support Vector Machine](/public-garden/notes/Machine Learning/Supervised Learning/🛩️ Support Vector Machine.html). We optimize a classifying hyperplane $$w$$, updating it if we get a prediction wrong and keeping it the same if we get a prediction right.

We update the plane by modifying its perpendicular vector to look more like the example we get wrong. In other words, our update step is 

$$

w = w + \eta y^{(i)}x^{(i)}

$$

with a certain learning rate $$\eta$$.

> If the data is linearly separable, the algorithm will converge after $$<\frac{R^2}{\gamma^2}$$ mistakes where $$R = \max_i \Vert x_i\Vert_2$$ (size of biggest $$x_i$$) and margin $$\gamma < y_iw^Tx_i$$.

If the data is not linearly separable, the simple perceptron will keep updating $$w$$, we can need to manually stop training. After stopping, there are variations in the way we get our final model.
1.  Voted perceptron: keep track of all intermediate models, predict the majority vote of running input $$x$$ through all models
2.  Averaged perceptron: final model is average of all intermediate models, essentially an approximation of voted perceptron that has much faster prediction times

A nuanced variation is the Margin-Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA), a type of passive-aggressive perceptron that which minimizes the hinge loss at each observation. It updates $$w$$ to be as close as possible to the old weights while setting hinge loss to $$0$$ (in case of misclassification or correct prediction within the margin); in other words, it makes the smallest change to $$w$$ for a correct prediction outside the margin.

## Model
Same as SVM, we maintain a hyperplane $$w$$ that splits the $$x$$ space, classifying each side. We update the hyperplane with learning rate $$\eta$$, which we can configure to be different for different loss functions; the passive-aggressive perceptron, for example, uses it to optimize hinge loss.

## Training
Given training data $$D$$, randomly initialize hyperplane $$w$$.

While $$w$$ incorrectly classifies datapoints in $$D$$, for each $$x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}$$,
1. Predict $$\hat{y} = sign(w^Tx^{(i)})$$.
2. If $$\hat{y} \neq y_i$$, update 

$$

w = w + \eta y^{(i)}x^{(i)}

$$

> For a multi-class perceptron, in case of a wrong class prediction, we update both the weights for the correct and incorrect classes; the former adds $$\eta x^{(i)}$$ while the latter subtracts it.

For simple perceptrons, $$\eta = 1$$; with passive-aggressive perceptrons, 

$$

\eta = L(w \vert x_i, y_i) / \Vert x_i\Vert^2

$$

where $$L$$ is the hinge loss $$L(w \vert x_i, y_i) = \max(0, 1 - y_iw^Tx_i)$$.

## Prediction
As with SVM, given input $$x$$, our prediction is $$\hat{y} = sign(w^Tx)$$.
