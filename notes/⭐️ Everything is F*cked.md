> How to live without hope, for a better world.

# Summary
1. We face the Uncomfortable Truth—that nothing really matters—because of an absence of control, values, or community.
2. The solution is not more hope but *amor fati*, or accepting our reality.
3. To live without hope is to live as a better person, by treating humanity as our ultimate end, embracing pain, and finding freedom in sacrifice.

# Thoughts
What a wild ride. This book is a giant mixing pot of ideas and philosophies, and it captures everything quite well (though with some random digressions that don't make much sense). It's a neat reminder of what I've learned but not practiced, and I'm so glad I read it.

There's just so much stuff to unpack that I'll probably need a second read in the future, but the ultimate message is clear: our good life is not a future we envision but one we can actively live in now. Neat.

# Notes
Hopelessness is the ultimate form of despair, and conversely, hope is the single most motivational force that powers us. It implies that there's a better future awaiting us and gives us a sense of purpose. Most importantly, it protects us from the Uncomfortable Truth—that we don't really matter, and nothing cares.

In the modern day, the rate of progress is astonishing, but hopelessness is more rampant than ever. To understand this trend, we must first analyze the three necessary ingredients for hope: control, values, and community.

## Control
There's a common assumption that if we were perfectly rational, we would have complete self-control. This is false.

The case of failed lobotomies shows that an absence of emotions, rather than giving allowing us to direct the course of our lives, turns us into passive potatoes. Self-control requires more than just willpower.

We are driven to action by emotion. Thoughts serve to influence our emotions, but ultimately, it's our Feeling Brain that drives our consciousness. The challenge is to balance both the Feeling and Thinking Brain; ignore the former, and you get potatoes; ignore the latter, and you get clowns; both fall into a crisis of hope, whether its an absence of excess of it.

Self-control is the result of using the Thinking Brain to cooperate with the Feeling Brain by analyzing its emotions and building systems to encourage positive ones for behaviors we want. It's feeling that "we deserve better," no matter what came before.

## Values
Newton's laws can be roughly translated to reflect how the world affects our values.
1. For every action, there is an equal and opposite emotional reaction: when something happens to us, whether good or bad, there's a moral gap that we feel we need to equalize, which pushes us to action. Our values are defined by these gaps—the good and bad things that happen to us over time.
2. Our self-worth equals the sum of our emotions over time: any moral gaps we fail to equalize become our baseline, and thus our perception shifts to justify whatever happened to us. In a sense, we're all slight narcissists saying "our struggles are special."
3. Your identity will stay your identity until a new experience acts against it: our values and meaning are defined by our past experiences, and we construct narratives around them. The only way we change is for us to feel the discomfort of a contradictory event, which throws our values into question; to get to this point, we must revise our narratives of the past and project new values into the future.

The values we build through our lives determines our emotional gravity, how we attract and repel the people around us. People with similar values get close, and people with different values drift away.

## Community
Communities are built on hope, and they have a name: religion. Each religion binds together people with similar values and offers them hope in the future. We can examine how they operate via a step-to-step guide on how to start one of our own.
1. Appeal to the hopeless, and give them faith.
2. Define a God Value, the most important value that followers believe in. This can be spiritual, ideological, or interpersonal.
3. Invalidate criticism with an us-versus-them dichotomy.
4. Build rituals and repeat them for a sense of importance.
5. Promise heaven and hell. The inevitability of pain is part of the human condition, but give your followers hope that it will eventually stop.
6. Decide what you want, and have your followers make it reality.

Believe it or not, we're all part of some religion. We all have faith in something and share our value hierarchies with a group of people.

## Modern Hopelessness
In the past, living was terrible, and nothing happened. No progress was being made, and people looked toward the afterlife for a better future. Nearly all believed in a spiritual religion.

With the scientific revolution, the rate of human progress picked up, and suddenly, our future is within our control. Now, more and more people subscribe to ideological beliefs.

The main problem here is that unlike spiritual ideas, ideological religions can be challenged, tested, and broken. And once this happens, lots of people are exposed to the Uncomfortable Truth. That is why now, in the modern day, "God is dead," and existential dread is rampant.

The most common cure to this illness is hope.

But hope is a double-edged sword. It inspired humanitarian efforts but also dictators and tyrants. **Hope is driven by our desire to destroy what currently is.** In other words, we have hope because of conflict and the meaning and purpose it introduces. Hope comes from the same source of division and hate. Humans are doomed to choose between tribalism and war or isolation and the Uncomfortable Truth.

Nietzsche believed that hope was not the answer to the impending existential crisis. Rather, he commanded *amor fati*, "love of one's fate," the unconditional acceptance of our life and experience.

> To love our fate is to close our desires and reality not by striving for the desires but by desiring reality. In other words, hope for nothing.

In this modern age, our solution is to act without hope, to be better instead of hoping to be better. We must deny our Feeling Brain the meaning and purpose it so craves and go beyond the ideals of good and evil, instead embracing what *is*.

## How we grow
Children act because something feels good. Adolescents act by following some principles to feel good. Adults act by following these principles simply because they're their values.

Children grow by learning the consequences of their actions. Adolescents grow by learning the limits of bargaining and transactional thinking.

To be adults, we must learn to act without expecting anything back, to do something unconditionally because it is the value that's good. Religions encourage this growth through their own versions of unconditional love, forgiveness, or whatever, but because they're human institutions, they're destined to corrupt.

## Formula of Humanity
Kant rejected all these religions and deduced that the supreme value is simply the thing that conceives of value itself—the ability to form meaning. Consciousness is the greatest force in the universe and the method to which we should live our lives.

The Formula of Humanity states, "Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means." In other words, humanity should never be conditional but instead something we want for its own sake. We should never treat someone else as a means to some other end.

Hope is never part of this principle. We don't need to hope for a better life—we just need to live it now, in the present.

## Pain, the universal constant
Psychological experiments have revealed that the more we look for something, the more we will see them, regardless of reality. In the modern day, that something is threats and pain. Even as things get better, smaller transgressions get bigger, and the world still seems terrible.

This is the hedonic treadmill, where no matter what happens, we eventually return to a baseline level of happiness and pain. In other words, pain is a universal constant. In fact, pain is the experience of life, and the absence or excess of it dictates how we feel.

This makes hope and the pursuit of happiness self-defeating and self-perpetuating. It teaches that we should be trying to avoid suffering when the real virtue is to suffer for the right reasons. Thich Quang Duc, a monk in South Vietnam, burned himself alive without flinching or opening his eyes; he is one of the greatest examples of one who suffered well, who sacrificed himself to change the world.

Our lives are perhaps less extreme, but it still begs the same question: will we engage our pain or avoid it? If we choose the former, we strengthen our psyche. By confronting our suffering, we can find the power to bear anything.

Pain is the source of all value, moral gaps, and purpose. It's our ability to feel pain for a purpose that gives life any meaning at all.

## True freedom
It's obvious now that nearly everything society achieves is a response to pain. Now, when given more opportunities and choices than ever before in history, our lives are catered to diversions from pain, thus making us more fragile. The modern pursuit of freedom and happiness pulls us back into childishness.

True freedom is self-limitation. It's choosing what to sacrifice—and thereby what to dedicate ourselves to. It's the conscious decision to live with less.

In the same vein, a free society is one where each person is forced to compromise with views and ideas different from their own. Modern society has forgotten this crucial principle of democracy.
