> The attachment styles that affect the way we love and bond in romantic relationships.

# Summary
1. We generally fit into an attachment styleâ€”secure, avoidant, or anxiousâ€”that characterizes the level of intimacy we're comfortable with.
2. Though difficult, it's impossible to develop greater security and move away from anxious or avoidant mindsets.
3. Finding a relationship built not only on love but also on compatibility between attachment styles is crucial to long-term satisfaction and happiness.

# Thoughts
The book brought up some very enlightening points. Overall, it neatly explains the feelings I had during my relationship. I used to be avoidant, maintaining the belief that "self-reliance equals independent" and failed to consider my partner's feelings and well-being. Highlighting my pitfalls and potential improvements is extremely helpful.

There is a strange discrepancy in the book's attitude toward changing our attachment style. It states, many times, that it's something that's difficult to change, yet a big portion of the book is dedicated to becoming more secure. I very much hope that it's possible to change, not just for compatibility but because I wish to have the characteristics, experiences, and love that comes with a more secure style.

It's been an interesting read, with down-to-life stories both happy and melancholic. The reminders and tips extracted from its many research studies have helped me become more self-aware and confident in self improvement.

# Notes
The three styles are Secure, Anxious and Avoidant, defined by attitudes toward intimacy. The secure are comfortable with it, the anxious crave it, and the avoidant push it away.

Each style is characterized by a statement.
1. Secure: "I find it easy to get close to others and are comfortable depending on them (and vice versa). I don't often worry about losing or getting too close with someone."
2. Avoidant: "I'm uncomfortable with being close to others and have trouble allowing myself to depend on them. Intimacy makes me nervous."
3. Anxious: "I notice that others don't get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn't really love me."

The modern codependency movement emphasizes the need for self-love, self-worth, and a self-sufficient source of happiness. However, a blind application of these principles can easily cause our relationship to fail.

Instead, couplesÂ _can_Â depend on each other to fulfill their emotional needs. In fact, it's impossible for our psychological selves to not be affected by our partner. Ultimately, our sense of security cannot be filled by us alone, but by having our partner as a "secure base," we can then be free to explore the world knowing that they're by our side.

All this is to say that finding theÂ _right_Â partner, someone who desires a similar level of intimacy, who satisfies our needs and whose needs are satisfied by our style, is extremely important. And after finding this person, we can eagerly develop our bond with them without fear of losing ourselves.

## Identifying attachment styles
First, to identify our style (and someone else's), we can look for a few tells.

### Secure
1. Open communication.
2. Confidence in solving problems.
3. Comfortable with being alone, believes that they'll find someone.

### Avoidant
1. Emphasis on independence.
2. Unconscious distance between self and partner.

### Anxious
1. Overthinks small things.
2. Scared that they can't find another partner.

## Overcoming anxiety
Those with the anxious attachment style are particularly sensitive to their partner's availability. If they feel like the other person is unavailable, the relationship is under threat, and it's impossible to feel secure. Their attachment system activates, causing them to do all they can to feel a sense of closeness. When left unchecked, their actions devolve into "protest behaviors" that try to get their partner's attention at the risk of damaging the relationship; examples include excessive attempts at contact, withdraw, and becoming hostile.

To overcome anxiety, one must find someone secure and willing to be as close as they hope. This search may require them to expand their options, decreasing attachment to each individual, which calms their activations. Once they find a partner, they must communicate openly and clearly, making sure that the significant other understands their needs. Only by having a calm attachment system can anxious individuals discover the security unlocked in true love.

## Addressing avoidance
On the other hand, people with the avoidant attachment style focus on themselves. They hold the belief that each person should be self-reliant, mistaking the freedom to completely fulfill their own needs as independenceâ€”in fact, having someone who desires intimacy more than themselves inflates their self-esteem and perceived strength. However, this frame of thinking prevents them from developing closeness with their partners and consequently worsens their ability to empathize with them; they think, "I can satisfy my own needs, and my partner should be able to too without my help." When the other person tries to initiate intimacy, their attachment system deactivates, pushing their partner away.

Significant life changes usually spur avoidant individuals to change. By developing self-awareness, they can learn to let down their guard and focus instead on mutual support. Identifying signs of avoidant behavior and being grateful for the relationship are key steps to opening up to true intimacy.

## Nurturing security
Secure individuals believe that their partner is loving and that they themselves deserve love too. They're able to reach closer intimacy, have stronger empathetic connections, and more open discussions about emotions. With their partner, they create a protective shield, a secure base, and makes the rest of the world seem a bit less scary.

While many develop their secure mindset from childhood, it's possible for anyone to change their attachment style, whether it's from a particularly powerful relationship or constant self improvement.

To build a secure base, one must be available, support their partner from behind-the-scenes (leaving them feeling in control), and encourage personal growth. In short, this mindset holds the partner's well-being as one's own responsibility.

## The anxious-avoidant trap
A relationship between anxious and avoidant people is difficult. Without a push toward security, it's inevitable that the more it progresses, the wider the gap gets. One wants closeness, the other desires separation, and the relationship often goes through ups and downs of distance and intimacy.

A helpful technique to improve is "priming": reminding ourselves of a secure experience with someone else, whether a past relationship or role model. By thinking of what this person would do, we can consciously try to learn their thinking.

It's also crucial to reflect on our past memories, identifying our emotions, reasoning, and actions. By evaluating them from an attachment perspective, we can consider new ways we can act or think, inspired by our secure role model, for greater happiness.

## The inner circle
Anxious-avoidant couples tend to find that when they get closer to each other, they're treated worse. In fact, their partner is often more considerate to strangers and other friends.

The inner circle in a secure relationship is the opposite. Each others' well-being is the top priority. Both parties feel admired, protected, and close. It's hard for anxious or avoidant individuals to believe that this exists, but it does, and it's not even rare.

## Maintaining security
Communicating effectively is of utmost importance. Every worry or fear can be quelled simply by hearing what our partner has to say. There's simply no good reason not to talk about what's on our mind.

When conflict do inevitably arise, we can also learn to handle them with love. This means we show concern for the other person's well-being and focus on the central issue instead of veering off or generalizing. It's also crucial that both parties are engaged with the issue and effectively communicate their feelings and needs to each other.
