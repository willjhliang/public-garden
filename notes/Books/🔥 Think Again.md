## Notes
Rethinking is crucial to our daily lives; by challenging our existing beliefs, we can make better decisions.

### Individual rethinking
We naturally fall into three mindsets: a preacher promoting our beliefs, a prosecutor judging others', and a politician seeking to win an audience. All three entrench us deeper into our current beliefs, so we need to learn a fourth: a scientist, testing the limits of our understanding with hypotheses and experiments, which reduces the impact of confirmation and desirability bias, instead encouraging humility and curiosity.

In this mindset, we must find the sweet spot of confident humility: having faith our capability but questioning our strategies. Believe in yourself but be uncertain about your tools. Though this might encourage imposter syndrome, that can actually be a good thing: it keeps us attentive and motivates us to work harder and smarter.

In fact, there's a joy to being wrong because then we learned something. Once we detach our present from our past, future from our present, and reorient our identity around our values rather than ideology, we're free to be wrongâ€”maybe even gladâ€”because all that matters is that we're more correct in the long run, not the present moment.
