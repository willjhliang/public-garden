# ⌛️ The Power of Regret

> The psychology and philosophy of how regret empowers us to be better.

## Summary
1. Regret is universal and human, and it's a strong driving force for self-improvement.
2. The most serious forms of regret can be categorized as foundation, boldness, moral, or connection.
3. It's only human to make mistakes, and the sole purpose of feeling regret is to convert these emotions and lessons into change.

## Thoughts
Most of the start of the book was common sense, but it gets real near the end. I think the biggest takeaway here is that we are all human, and humans are imperfect. Mistakes are natural, and regret serves as a mechanism to grow.

I knew the tips for recovery, but hearing them again helps a lot. We've not defined by our mistakes if our future selves don't repeat them, and this is the sole purpose of regret—to motivate us to grow. This is how we leave our past behind us, and this is how we heal from the wounds we are dealt.

## Notes
### Accepting regret
Regret is one of the most common and fundamental negative emotions that makes us human, but we often throw around the phrase "no regrets" as if it's something to be damned.

In reality, regret can be a constructive force which, if utilized correctly, allows us to do better in the future and find meaning in our choices. We must learn from what we did wrong so our future can be the one we envisioned, the *if only*s. We also must look back and appreciate the decisions that got us here, the *at least*s.

In the face of regret, we have three possible responses. Ignorance leads to delusion, which must erupt one day or another. Feeling leads to despair, which chains us to repetitive bouts of depression and hopelessness.

Only by converting the acute pains of regret into thought can be improve ourselves. **Feeling is for thinking, and thinking is for action**. Our regret is a reflection of our past self and old choices, and if we isolate these mistakes, there is a clear path for self-improvement. In other words, regret fuels us to be a better person, to avoid the pitfalls that we fell into before.

### Types of regret
There are four main types of regret, categorized not by the actual subject but by the fundamental source of our mistake.
1. Foundation regrets are failures to plan ahead, generally accrued over a long period. These usually involve doing something in the extreme (saving too little money, for example) and must be addressed by not only recognizing the mistake but changing the environment to minimize its effect.
2. Boldness regrets, in contrast, are the things we didn't do, the relative extremes we didn't pursue. These are especially terrifying because they represent the general what-ifs we'll never get an answer to.
3. Moral regrets are transgressions that run counter to our morals. These usually involve deceit, infidelity, theft, betrayal, or sacrilege.
4. Connection regrets form from relationships we lose, mostly gradually as the two people drift apart. We're often concerned that attempts to reconnect are awkward or creepy, but these are usually not the case; much more often, we underestimate how much others would welcome us back.

All four of these types involve some missed opportunity or failed obligation. A study of America's regrets reveals that they most commonly originate from an opportunity we didn't take rather than obligations we didn't fulfill. It's the "could," rather than the "should," that pains us.

### Recovering and improving
The sole purpose of regrets is to fuel us to do better. The following are tips to overcome them and grow.
1. Directly undo the mistake, whether it's an apology or recovery.
2. Be grateful for the present with *at least*.
3. Tell it to someone or write it down.
4. Practice self-compassion by treating yourself like a friend. Being imperfect is part of the human experience.
5. View yourself from a detached lens, then analyze and strategize.

As for the future, we can anticipate potential regrets and act around them. However, we must also keep in mind that our projected emotions are often more negative than they actually will be; then, the choice that minimizes anticipated regret may not be the best one.

Moreover, constantly trying to minimize regret can become a form of unhealthy maximizing. Individuals who pursue the ideal are often more miserable than "satisficers", who want a "good enough." Instead of minimizing regret, our goal should be the optimize it: anticipate the regrets that matter, usually ones falling into one of the four categories above, and move on with the rest.

Ultimately, regret is a chance for us to do better. It's the start of redemption.
