# ðŸ’¼ Deep Work

> The most important skill in our information-age that leads to a more productive, balanced, and meaningful life.

## Summary
1. Deep work consists of distraction-free activities that push the limits of our concentration and capabilities.
2. We achieve depth by deliberately scheduling deep work sessions, embracing boredom, culling our tools, and minimizing shallow (non-deep) work.
3. Through deep work, we can go beyond what we initially thought was possible and find a new layer of meaning and joy in our lives.

## Thoughts
I've experienced deep work many times beforeâ€”training for USACO, grinding our english essays, studying for the SAT, and the like. This book explains and contextualizes many of the memories I have of that sacred flow state, and I hope by employing its strategies, I can achieve it more commonly and on command.

The main takeaway that stood out to me was that everything is a finite resource, except our mind. Attention and concentration is not endless, and we would do better than designing systems to conserve it. On the other hand, our mind is perfectly fine running at full capability and only requires change of focus. This methodical approach to how we work and focus is intriguing, and it's a much clearer perspective than the simple "willpower is king" idea I previously had.

## Notes
Deep work is, as defined in the book, "professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your sill, and are hard to replicate."

In other words, deep work is the trace we enter when we block everything out and focus on the task in front of us. To stay ahead in the information age, we must constantly learn complex material and create intricate systems, and thus deep work is crucial. It's the "superpower of the 21st century."

We often spend the whole day performing shallow work, distracted by hums and pings or other people. Instead, by performing just three to five hours of deep work a day, we can get the same stuff done, maybe even more, and leave our evenings to relax. A common way to achieve this is through batching: performing hard work in long, interrupted stretches. This maximizes both intensity and duration, minimizing the attention lost when switching tasks.

### Shallow work
Shallow work, fostered in the culture of connectivity, is incredibly popular in the corporate world. This has become the norm because it makes work easy (termed the Principle of Least Resistance): we get instant access to help, and we feel productive by helping and responding. Furthermore, given the vague metrics of success in the workplace, many people turn to busynessâ€”visibly doing a lot of stuffâ€”as an indicator for productivity; there's no easier way to appear busy than to respond to emails, attend meetings, and the likeâ€”all forms of shallow work.

There's also our fixation with modern technology, especially the internet. If something isn't "with the times," then it's usually ignored. Unfortunately, this includes all the modern distractions, most notably social media, that ruins attempts that deep work.

### Finding meaning
Deep work not only improves the quality of our work but also gives extra meaning to our lives. This can be explained from three perspectives.
1. The neurological stance suggests that what we focus on contributes significantly to how we view the world. If we give our full attention to deep work, it's easier to find meaning in what we're doing.
2. Psychologically, researchers have established that one of the best moments we can have is the flow state, when we push ourselves to the limit in a challenging task. Deep work is a natural way to enter flow.
3. A part of philosophy claims that the skill in craftsmanship is our way of finding meaning; in this sense, deep work and the appreciation of our craft is essential ot extracting meaning from our profession.

As claimed by these three fields studying the human condition, "a deep life is a good life, any way you look at it."

### Strategies for depth
Unfortunately, deep work is not a natural desire we have. Distractions are constantly around us, and we must exert willpowerâ€”a finite resourceâ€”to keep ourselves on track. Thus, it's crucial to maintain routines and rituals avoid exhausting our willpower.

Depending on our work and obligations, there are four main philosophies.
1. Monastic: minimize shallow obligations, maintain clarity on one specific thing.
2. Bimodal: divide time into deep work and everything else, act monastically for the former, usually for at least a day.
3. Rhythmic: turn deep work sessions into a simple regular habit.
4. Journalistic: fit deep work wherever you can in your schedule, which requires fast mode shifting.

During deep work sessions, build rituals to repeat day after day; this helps ensure that we can go deep consistently. Maintain location, duration, methods, and support.

Grand gestures can also help. By radically changing our environment and investing money into it, we increase the perceived importance of our task and thereby boost our motivation.

> Note that though these rules imply alone work, collaboration can also be a form of deep work, if done correctly. Individuals must challenge each other to be better and still minimize distractions.

There are also four cornerstones of the deep work framework. These are rules that encourage successful execution on top of the strategies above.
1. Set specific, wild goals.
2. Track the time spent in deep work.
3. Keep a physical scoreboard of the time spent.
4. Review and analyze performance each week.

Outside of work, maintain a period each day to completely shut out the work world. This idle time is necessary to recharge our attention and gain insight unconsciously.

### Embrace boredom
The ability to concentrate is not sufficient to consistently go deep. We must also address the converseâ€”our hardwired need for distractions.

By training ourselves to be fine without distractions (literally be bored), we can then concentrate longer when we need to. Instead of thinking about what small periods of time where we can find something entertaining, we should instead deliberately assign time to be blissfully distractedâ€”and the rest of the day will be distraction-free, training ourselves to resist stimuli.

Other smaller methods include setting harsh deadlines to force hard concentration, practicing productive mediation (think hard about one thing during a physical activity), and practice memorization.

> There is a common misconception that our brain needs downtimeâ€”periods of near-zero concentration or attentionâ€”that's usually achieved by giving into clickbait distractions. However, unlike muscles, the brain actually just requires change; using it at full capacity during leisure (in reading, for example) is a much better alternative.

### Deliberate tools
Tools, especially those on the internet, can be both beneficial and harmful. We must choose them deliberately to ensure that they serve their intended purpose.

Simply put, adopt a tool only if the pros outweigh the cons. We must systematically evaluate them against our values, keeping in mind that usually, most of our benefit comes from a small fraction of the tools we use.

### Minimize shallow work
Shallow work often appears more important at the moment than it actually is. The following strategies help us cull the unneeded shallow parts of the day to make way for deep work or leisure.
1. Schedule every minute of the day to make it deliberate, reducing the time wasted on autopilot. This isn't a hard constraintâ€”it's fine to break free of the schedule if neededâ€”but a thoughtful plan.
2. Quantify each activity's depth by estimating the number of months needed to train a college graduate to perform the task.
3. Set a shallow-work budget, and stick to it.
4. Finish working at a set time, a strategy called fixed-schedule productivity. This limits our shallow work and forces us to plan out our days, essentially combining the above ideas into one core strategy.

Lastly, email has risen to be one of the biggest shallow-work activities we partake in. If it's permissible, we can do much better by setting filters, responding with intent, and selectively choosing which emails are worth our time.
