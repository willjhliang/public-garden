# ðŸ‘Ÿ Atomic Habits

> How to achieve remarkable results with tiny changes, one day at a time.

## Summary
1. Habits are incredibly powerful as they drive small changes that build up over time.
2. Before we commit ourselves to building a new habit, we must first shift our identity to the person we want to be.
3. To sustain a habit, we must make the cue obvious, craving attractive, response easy, and reward satisfying.

## Thoughts
While I already knew and integrated most of the lessons in this book into my life, its systematic way of detailing every component of a habit helped clarify and rationalize my behavior.

More importantly, by bringing these ideas to the foreground, I'm able to deliberately integrate them into areas that I need to work on, specifically emotional intelligence and relationships, rather than subconsciously apply them to what I'm already doing good at. I've always been using a program I intuitively developed for academics, but I've yet to apply it to other parts of my life. Having this concrete structure is tremendously helpful in consciously reminding myself of the things I need to work on and how I can improve.

## Notes
### Atomic changes
Small improvements compound into huge changes over time. Because our growth curve is exponential, we will likely fail to meet expectations in the beginning. However, over time, the small one-percent tweaks build up, and they'll eventually go far beyond what we initially hoped.

Therefore, we shouldn't be focused on pushing toward concrete goals. Rather, it's more effective to build a system of atomic habits that will naturally produce results over time. In other words, we must focus not onÂ _what_Â we want to do butÂ _how_Â to do it.

### Forming our identity
But before defining what outcome we want or what process we should follow, we must first think of the person we want to be. Defining an identity naturally leads to changes in behavior and results.

For example, for someone who wants to quit smoking, "I don't want to smoke" and "I'm not a smoker" are fundamentally different. The former still believes that they are a smoker whereas the latter has already shifted their identity, thus making it easier to follow through.

With a desired identity in place, we can then start to change our behavior. Every small win is evidence that we actuallyÂ _are_Â who we set out to be, and as time passes, our beliefs about ourselves change too.

### Four laws of behavior change
With our set identity in mind, we can build our desired habit from four crucial components.
1. Cue: The prompt that hints at a possible reward.
2. Craving: The desire or motivation associated with the cue.
3. Response: Our action, the actual habit, that reaches for the reward.
4. Reward: The end goal that satisfies our craving and teaches us the expected result of our response.

To successfully build a habit, we must make the process of going through these four steps as desirable as possible. We must make the cue obvious, the craving attractive, the response easy, and the reward satisfying.

### Make it obvious
Cues are largely invisible, allowing us to execute habits unconsciously. In order to change an existing habit, we must start with awareness, either by writing it down or verbalizing our unconscious actions.

As for forming new habits, our cues should be clear and obvious. The most common cues are time and location, and they must be specific; with a set plan to execute the habit, we develop a much stronger intention to commit. Alternatively, it might be easier to pair the new habit with an existing one, following the framework "after I do this, I'll start doing that."

We must also keep in mind that environment has an especially powerful impact on our behavior. Our actions are prompted by our relationship to objects around us, so by making the cues of good habits stand out in our environment, we're more likely to do them. Conversely, we can reduce bad habits by making those cues invisible, thereby avoiding temptation rather than testing our ability to resist it.

Moreover, we must be intentional with our environment; the bedroom is for sleeping, library is for studying, and lounge for relaxing. Defining our desired behavior in each context makes it much easier to follow through with them.

### Make it attractive
Habits rely on our belief that the action will elicit some reward. It's the anticipation of a reward, not the reward itself, that motivates us to act in the first place.

Thus, we must make a new habit appear attractive. One method is to pair a habit we need to do with something we want to do, thereby making the former far more attractive than it would be on its own. For example, if we want to watch Youtube, we can motivate ourselves to exercise by establishing the rule that Youtube is only allowed during workouts.

Our culture also significantly impacts the behavior we exhibit. Specifically, we tend to imitate habits of the close, the many, and the powerful. Thus, it's incredibly effective to join a culture where a desired habit is the normal behavior of the group. If that habit wins us approval, respect, and praise, it'll be much more attractive.

Reframing our habit to something positive is also helpful. Taken a step farther, we can build a motivation ritual where we do something we enjoy immediately after the new habit. Our habit will naturally be associated with positive feelings, and it will itself become a cue that prompts a craving for those feelings.

### Make it easy
Learning comes from practice, not planning. In order to end procrastination and take action, we must first make it easy to do.

The Law of Least Effort states that humans naturally do what requires the least amount of energy. Thus, it's crucial that we prime our environment to reduce the friction necessary for a new habit. Similarly, high friction will deter us from falling into bad ones.

Even with a well-prepared environment, friction is at its peak right before we begin the habit. As a temporary remedy, we can build quick, easy habits that push us in the right direction; the Two-Minute Rule states that every new habit should take less than two minutes to complete. Then, once we get started on this path, it's much easier to keep going and achieve the actual habit we desire.

We can also turn to commitment devices that force our future behavior by making it harder to avoid the habit than to do it. If we delete social media apps, we're much less likely to reinstall them, log in, and start browsing. In this sense, when we automate parts of our habit, we're effectively guaranteeing our future behavior to strictly follow what we planned.

### Make it satisfying
We'll repeat a behavior if the experience itself is satisfying, but more often than not, a good habit pays out in the long term and lacks any short term benefits. In order to increase the chances that we continue the habit, we must associate a small, immediate reward to the habit. Delayed gratification will kick in later, but for the first few weeks or months, this secondary reward is what motivates us to keep going.

On top of the immediate reward, we must also feel like we're making progress. Using a habit tracker (like marking a calendar) is an excellent way to not only make the habit satisfying but also keep a visual record. With this, we can focus on keeping the streak alive, and even if it breaks, we must never miss twice;Â **one day is a mistake, two days is the beginning of a new bad habit**.

Inversely, to make a bad habit unsatisfying, we must create an immediate consequence. For example, we can agree to a specified punishment and have someone keep us in check. Knowing that there's another person involved is a powerful deterrent.

### Maximizing success
Building habits is the path to success, but there are other factors to consider as well. The following tips deal with not only habits but skills in general.
1. Though hard work is important, we're undoubtedly born with gifts in certain areas. Our genes dictate our opportunities, and work decides our passion. Thus, picking a focus that plays to the strengths of our personality and abilities can make the difference between good and great.
2. As we get used to our activities, we must gradually adjust them to be more challenging. The Goldilocks Rule states that we maximize motivation when the task is on the edge of our abilities. Even so, there will be days when we're bored and habits become routine; pushing through the boredom and keeping the streak despite our lack of motivation is part of the path towards mastery.
3. Learning to do things automatically is a double-edged sword. While the benefits of a good habit are obvious, the one downside is that it gradually dulls our ability; little errors start to pile up. Reflection and self-awareness are critical to adapting our behavior and identity as times change. We must keep our performance in mind from time to time and also check that our identity is flexible and free to grow.

### Final tips
1. Awareness (cue) precedes desire (craving).
2. Happiness comes from the absence of desire.
3. We chase our idea of pleasure, not the satisfaction itself.
4. Observation without craving leads to peace.
5. "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how."
6. Curiosity is more important than intelligence.
7. Emotions influence our behavior.
8. Psychologically, logic comes after emotions.
9. We often act following our emotions.
10. Progress is powered by suffering.
11. Actions speak toward a goal's importance.
12. Reward requires sacrifice.
13. Self-control is difficult because it lacks satisfaction.
14. Satisfaction is the difference between expectation and reality.
15. Pain of failure correlates with desire.
16. Feelings influence us both before and after behavior.
17. Desire motivates us to act while pleasure motivates us to repeat.
18. With experience, hope is replaced by acceptance.
