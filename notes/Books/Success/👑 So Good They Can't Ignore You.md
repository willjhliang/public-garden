# ðŸ‘‘ So Good They Can't Ignore You

> Why working right trumps finding the right work.

## Summary
1. Following our passion to find a job is terrible advice since it's fickle and ambiguous.
2. The single best thing we can do to love our work is to learn rare and valuable skills, thereby acquiring career capital.
3. Career capital can then be invested into control and mission, two core values that make our work satisfying and meaningful.

## Thoughts
It's a short little book, but the theory it proposes matches my personal experience. In short, passion is a product of mastery, not a prerequisite. I was lucky enough to be dumb and little and start on CS just because, and through the time I invested in it, it became my passion.

The biggest takeaway for me is actually his description of deliberate work and the difference between those who are great and those who plateau. We must always seek challenges, and doing something easy will do nothing for my skill. I can't forget that.

## Notes
"Follow your passion" is not good advice. Fulfilling that dream does not magically make your life wonderful, nor is it the answer to why some people love their work. In fact, the true solution goes beyond *What should I do with my life?*, instead addressing a slightly-different perspective: *How do I end up loving what I do?*

Instead, there are four rules to follow that'll help us end up at the right conclusion.
1. Don't follow your passion.
2. Be so good they can't ignore you.
3. Turn down a promotion (to retain control).
4. Think small, act big.

### Don't follow passion
The passion hypothesis states that the key to occupational happiness is to find a job that matches your passion; in other words, passion comes first, job second.

Steve Jobs famously urged Stanford grads in his commencement speech to follow their passions and achieve their dreams. But if we carefully examine the start of Apple, we see a different Jobsâ€”his passion was spiritualism, and computers was a side activity purely to make money. He may have grown more passionate as the company grew, but Apple certainly did not start from his passion.

Most careers start in this fashion. It's difficult to predict what we'll eventually love, the the origin of compelling careers is often more complicated than a simple passion. Social science research suggests that passions take time to develop, arise as a side effect of mastery, and often can't even be converted to a career at all.

### Become great
The passion mindset focuses on what the work can offer us. This not only makes us pay attention to its downsides but also fails to answer the fundamental questions of passion: *Who am I?* and *What do I truly love?*

On the other hand, the craftsman mindset focuses on what we can offer the world. The center of this thinking is the quality of what we produce with our craft, which demands dedication to deliberate practiceâ€”strategic, hard work that constantly pushes our limits. Most masters pour thousands of hours into challenging practice, and this is the path to loving what we do.

> Deliberate practice is far beyond just throwing hours into a skill. The difference between those who plateau and those who go beyond is not the time spent but the effort put into conquering activities just outside their range of ability and receiving timely feedback for improvement.

Starting out, our task at hand is to put aside the question of whether the job is our passion. Our focus should be to become so good they can't ignore us. Though this is a leap of faith, it's rooted in the fundamental definition of good jobs.

A job is great if it has creativity, impact, and control. These traits are both rare and valuable, which makes them accessible to only people who can offer something great in returnâ€”people who can produce something great with the rare and valuable skills they acquired. These skills are our career capital, and the more we have, the better work we get.

At the core of the craftsman mindset is the drive to acquire career capital. By mastering the craft, we'll automatically get a great job. In contrast, the passion mindset urges us to commit to jobs where we have little career capital and will often fail.

However, the craftsman mindset is not entirely job-agnostic. If any of following is a characteristic of the craft, it will not succeed.
1. Few opportunities to distinguish oneself with rare and valuable skills.
2. Achieves something useless or negative for the world.
3. Forces engagement with a toxic community.

### Buying control
Control is one of the most universally important traits to great workâ€”a dream-job elixir that we can purchase with career capital. As observed in research literature, increasing control over what we do increases happiness, engagement, and fulfillment.

Getting control requires career capital, else the effort is fruitless. But once we are valuable enough, employers will resist our attempts at control, and we must push through. The balance of career capital between these two control traps can be found with this simple law: introduce more control only if there's evidence that people will pay for it. If people will pay, then this move is clearly valuable enough to commit to.

### Build a mission
A clear and compelling mission can also be a source of great happiness and satisfaction. It's the unifying focus of our work, the answer to *What should I do with my life?*

This mission also requires capital: strong missions can only arise after sufficient understanding and mastery. To get here, we must think about a narrow field, get to the cutting edge, and then discover a big mission.

With mastery, we can arrive at a mission-oriented career through tiny bets, feeling out the direction of our work with small commitments that'll compound over time. These exploratory steps give us the best chance of succeeding at whatever mission we have chosen.

Armed with a mission, we can create remarkable projectsâ€”ones that generate buzz and launched in a supportive community. It's this marketing-centric thinking that separates a normal project (a brown cow) from a successful, fulfilling one (a purple cow).
