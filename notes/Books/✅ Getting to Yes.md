## Summary

## Thoughts

## Notes
### Problem
TBD

### Method
We often forget that we're dealing with people, not abstract representatives, in a negotiation. As such, our negotiation deals with both the deal itself and a relationship with another person. However, the relationship tends to become entangled with the problem—egos get involved, and emotions flare up.

Our goal is the separate the relationship from the substance and deal directly with the people problem. To do so, we must address perceptions, emotions, and communication.
1. Perception is how the other party sees the situation. We must understand their point of view, share our own, make sure all parties are involved in negotiations, and align proposals to their values.
2. Emotions may be more important than the content itself. We must recognize, understand, and acknowledge them. It's also okay to let the other side let off steam, but we can't react to emotional outbursts.
3. Communication is always key. We must listen actively and speak to be understood. Our content should be purposeful and focused about ourself.

Ultimately, to prevent any people problems from arising, we must build a working relationship and face the problem, not the person.

==chapter 3 TBD==

The pie is often not a fixed size, and we can expand it by finding options for mutual gain. However, this often doesn't happen because of premature judgement, bias toward a single answer, assuming a fixed pie, or focusing too much on our own interests.

To start inventing new options, we must separate invention from judgement, broaden options, search for mutual gain, and figure out how to make their decisions easy. During brainstorms, our process should be to first diagnose the problem, then analyze, find approaches, and detail action items.
