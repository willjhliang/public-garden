# Notes
Information-based bargaining focuses on solid planning, careful listening, and signal interpretation. The goal is to get as much knowledge about the situation and other party as possible.

## Six foundations
The six factors behind bargaining are personal style, goals and expectations, authoritative standards, relationships, other party's interests, and leverage.
1. Personal style, influenced by family, gender and culture, is the backbone of our negotiation strategy, and our goal should be to amplify its strengths and cover its weaknesses. Both cooperative and competitive predispositions can be successful, but no matter the case, we must have a willingness to prepare, high expectations, the patience to listen, and a commitment to integrity.
2. The more committed and specific we are to a vision, the more likely we are to achieve it. Our goals—somewhat of an upper bound—must be aspirational, target expectations high, and lower bound realistic; during the negotiation, it's important to keep our target in mind and measure our progress relative to it. Moreover, the accompanying confidence and resolve is visible to the other party and will make a difference in the coming negotiation.
3. Standards, norms, and authority, if prepared well, can form the backbone of our arguments. We all want to appear consistent, and we can gain normative leverage by pivoting the standards adopted by the other party to advance our own position. This principle is employed in consistency traps, which bind us to pre-committed standards that later turn against our interests (usually set by getting us to agree to a statement before revealing its purpose or importance), and positioning themes, which defines the problem and lays out our interests and norms. Finally, if the other party's standards are vastly different from our own, we can turn to a third-party audience to establish common ground.
4. Relationships create trust, easing anxiety and facilitating communication. Everyone has a natural instinct to reciprocate our actions; these responses are based on trustworthiness, fairness, and firmness. Through them, we can form strong working relationships with the principal of similarity, gift-giving, and mutual networks. However, we must also be wary of trusting too quickly, reciprocity traps, and high stakes.
5. Seeing the negotiation from the other party's point is view is crucial. Partisan perceptions, competitiveness, and negotiation dynamics work against this purpose, but there are steps to do better: identify the other party's decision maker, look for common ground, identify conflicting interests, and find low-cost options to solve the other party's problems.
6. Leverage: TBD

## Negotiation Process
Now, we can use the six foundations to achieve our goals in the negotiation process, which consists of four steps: preparation, information exchange, proposing and concession making, and commitment.

During preparation, our goal is to construct a plan of action. Each negotiation fits one of four categories depending on the importance of a future relationship and the perceived level of conflict: balanced concerns, relationships, transactions, and tacit coordination. To prepare, we must identify the type of situation we're facing and use a fitting strategy below.

Next, we should examine the situation from the other party's point of view. Finally, we must choose our mode of communication and whether to use an agent or not. With all this in place, we can put it together in a series of questions to ask when the negotiation starts, testing our assumptions against reality.
