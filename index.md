# Hello!
{: .fs-9 }

Welcome to my knowledge store! This is a collection of university and research notes by [Will Liang](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~wjhliang/). Topics include machine learning, computer vision, and random other computer science tidbits.

# About
I'm Will, a student at the University of Pennsylvania. My notetaking strategy centers around clear, intuitive explanations addressed to my future self, sort of like the [Feynman approach to learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching). I've built up quite a bit of material over the years, and I thought it would be helpful to share them here!

# Explore
Take a look around with the side bar. My notes are roughly organized by field, but there no sort order due to the emojis. (Sorry about that.)

# Search
If there's anything you're looking for, use the search bar up top. On the right of that is a link to my personal site, which contains some more information as well.

> This website is updated regularly and features my latest notes, including ones that are incomplete. I'll generally try to include a warning on unfinished notes. Also, please let me know if you spot any mistakes; my email is willjhliang@gmail.com.

If you're wondering how I built this site, check out the [github](https://github.com/willjhliang/public-garden). My end to end pipeline consists of Obsidian Git, a git submodule, Github Actions, Jekyll, and Github Pages. Details are in the repository README.
