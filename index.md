# Hello!
{: .fs-9 }

Welcome to my knowledge store! This is a collection of university and research notes by [Will Liang](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~wjhliang/). Topics include machine learning, computer vision, and random other computer science tidbits.

## Explore
Take a look around with the side bar. My notes are roughly organized by field, but there no sort order due to the emojis. (Sorry about that.)

## Search
If there's anything you're looking for, use the search bar up top. On the right of that is a link to my personal site, which contains some more information as well.

## About This Project
I study with the Feynman technique, so I try to style these notes as instructional materials addressed to my future self. Some of them have gotten refined enough to share with others, so I'm publishing everything on here. Huge thanks to Just the Docs for the template!

> This website is updated regularly and features my latest notes, including ones that are incomplete. I'll generally try to include a warning on unfinished notes. Also, please let me know if you spot any mistakes; my email is willjhliang@gmail.com.

If you're wondering how I built this site, check out the [github](https://github.com/willjhliang/public-garden). My end to end pipeline consists of Obsidian Git, a git submodule, Github Actions, Jekyll, and Github Pages. Details are in the repository README.
