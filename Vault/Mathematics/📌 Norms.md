Norm of $x$, denoted $\Vert x \Vert$, represents the “size” of the vector with three properties.
1.  $\Vert x \Vert > 0$ for $x \neq 0$ and $\Vert x \Vert = 0$ for $x = 0$
2.  $\Vert kx \Vert = \vert k \vert * \Vert x \Vert$
3.  $\Vert x + y \Vert \leq \Vert x \Vert + \Vert y \Vert$

$\Vert x-y \Vert$ is usually used as a distance measurement since it’s symmetric, non-negative, and preserves the triangle inequality.

$P$-norm is defined as 

$$

\Vert x \Vert_p = (\sum_{i=1}^m \vert x_i\vert^p)^{1/p}

$$

However, for extreme values of $p$, there are special norms.
1. For $p = 0$, $\Vert x\Vert_0 = \sum_{i=1}^m \mathbf{1}(x_i \neq 0)$. In other words, this is the number of non-zero elements in $x$.
2. For $p = \inf$, $\Vert x\Vert_{\inf} = \max_i \vert x_i\vert$. This is the maximum magnitude value in $x$.

>Note that $L_0$ is a pseudo-norm since it violates the second property defined above. $L_0(av) \neq \vert a\vert L_0(v)$, and instead, $L_0(av) = L_0(v)$ for $a \neq 0$.

For a matrix, we commonly use the Frobenius norm, a function of the elements in the matrix or the singular values of the matrix. 

$$

\Vert A\Vert_F = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\vert a_{i,j}\vert^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{\min(n, m)}\sigma_i^2}

$$
