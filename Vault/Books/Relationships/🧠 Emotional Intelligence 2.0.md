> An objective breakdown of how individuals develop EQ.

# Summary
1. EQ consists of four skills: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.
2. By understanding ourselves, we can learn to understand others and improve how we interact with the people around us.

# Thoughts
Truthfully, this book wasn't that helpful. Many points were obvious, and there were only a few key reminders that I noticed. It's also organized in a pretty haphazard way—writing notes was a lot more tiring compared to other books; I had to manually link many ideas together when they should've been explicitly discussed in the first place.

It's a decent introduction to EQ, but it's not helpful for anyone who already has a decent grasp of it.

# Notes
Humans naturally put emotions above reason; signals from the spinal cord go through the limbic system (responsible for emotions) before reaching the rational part.

Thus, it's common for emotions to hijack our brains in critical moments. Our initial reaction is always emotion, but the key is that the thoughts that follow can be trained to be rational.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand emotions in ourselves and others as well as our application of this knowledge in our behavior and relationships. It's not dependent on intelligence or personality and is actually, in conjunction with the other two, one of the three distinct qualities that govern our mindset.

There are four main skills. For personal competence, there's self-awareness and self-management. For social competence, there's social awareness and relationship management.

## Self-awareness
Self-awareness is the ability to think through our emotions and figure out their origins. In doing so, we gain an understanding of what triggers certain emotions, allowing us to grow and improve. It also allows us to maximize strengths and recover from weaknesses, leading to greater overall satisfaction.

To first truly recognize an emotion, we must refrain from labeling it as "good" or "bad." This way, we prevent ourselves from avoiding negative feelings and instead allow ourselves to experience it as a motivator for change. Moreover, it'll be easier to isolate the cause and recognize what factors trigger an emotional response.

In other words, from time to time, we need to stop and ask _why_ we do the things we do. And similarly, it helps to define our values and evaluate our actions against them.

To be objective, it also helps to view ourselves as a third party, slowing down and analyzing everything that's happening. It's similar to identifying how we relate to something we see in media, whether's a scene or song. Finally, it helps to objectively write down our analyses in a journal, reflecting on our behavior that day.

Stress and mood is unpredictable, and it can easily sway our perception and reactions to the world. The only way to address this is to wait for the storm to pass.

Aside from introspection, we can also learn to recognize our body's physical changes. How we look from the outside, whether it's a reaction or our appearance in general, is a steady signal of our mood or stress.

Finally, We must also recognize how our feelings affect others, even without us meaning to. Self-awareness is not only recognition of our inner self but also how our outer self makes ripples around us.

## Self-management
Self-management is our capacity to employ awareness to be flexible and positively modify our behavior. With it, we can control our emotional reactions, deal with fear, and act intelligently. In doing so, we look over temporary emotion-driven needs and focus on more important long-term goals.

One easy way to improve self-management is to literally slow down and take deep breaths. Increased oxygen helps us relax and powers up our rational thinking. Similarly, counting to ten or sleeping on the problem—letting time help us gain control of our emotions—can do wonders.

To get in touch with our feelings, it helps to list out the emotions and reasons behind the situation. It's important to recognize when emotions cloud our judgment but also when reason ignores cues from our emotions. Setting some time aside every day to problem solve our feelings is a great way to ensure that we understand our emotions.

Moreover, we must also learn to restrain our negative inner voices. They can be unrealistic and self-defeating, yet they have a profound impact on our emotions. Instead, we should visualize what our success looks like, simulating the positive emotions that come with it.

Similarly, we must focus on our freedoms rather than limitations. Treat our problems as opportunities to learn and grow. Being open to change dramatically shifts our mindset to one that's more rational and stable.

While we may struggle to keep ourselves in check, it can be effective to have others keep us accountable as well. As for our emotions, smiling on the outside through negativity often lifts our mood—it shouldn't eliminate the mood, but it's a temporary escape. Keeping good body language, maybe even by focusing on another task at hand, helps synchronize our emotions as well.

Also, it's always helpful to talk with skilled self-managers. Another audience could be someone who's not emotionally invested in our problem and hear their unbiased perspective.

Finally, sleep hygiene is critical—the quality of our sleep impacts our patience, flexibility, and alertness, qualities that are critical to self-management. Taking breaks can also have a similar effect.

## Social awareness
Social awareness is the ability to read other people and understand their thoughts and feelings. It involves listening and observing without being caught up in our own emotions and wants.

The easiest first step to take is to greet others by their name; it's an important part of their identity, and it establishes a more personal connection.

Most importantly, we must pay attention to body language. Then, by noticing others' feelings, we can then time our interactions appropriately. We can also learn their culture and expectations and adjust our interactions accordingly. In other words, noticing their cues allows us to step into their shoes—the golden rule of social awareness.

We must focus on the speaker and quiet our inner voices, cleaning the clutter that prevents us from truly listening. This way, we can notice the tone, speed, and volume of their voice that hints that the speaker's true frame of mind.

Be as present as possible so that our planning and thoughts don't distract us from the people currently around us. In other words, live in the moment. Similarly, it can be helpful to take a few minutes out of our day to just walk around and notice small things around us; forgetting our plans and goals for a bit can help us see more clearly.

We can practice awareness by observing characters in movies; they're more distant from our actual lives, so they can be easier to read. Another tactic is to go people watching, which yields the same benefits.

Finally, to access how we're doing, simply ask. Stating our observations and our analysis is an easy way to make sure we're accurate. Asking for someone's overall perception of us is also critical to understanding our skill.

As for some miscellaneous tips: Keeping a back-pocket question prepared is a good way to keep the conversation going. Furthermore, planning for social gatherings keeps us on track, allowing us to be more present.

## Relationship management
Relationship management is the use of awareness to foster successful interactions. With clear communication and effective conflict resolution, we can better understand others and treat them well, leading to deeper relationships.

Relationships are built on knowledge about each other, so we must be open about ourselves and curious about the other person. Similarly, we can improve our communication by enhancing the upsides of our communication style and eliminating the downsides. In time, we'll learn to build trust with others through open communication, along with consistency, willingness to share, and reliability.

An "open door" policy is also critical to strengthening relationships. It's crucial that the other person feels like you're accessible and open to communication. It's also essential to acknowledge others' feelings, showing that on top of being open, we're also attentive and caring. This way, we can respond appropriate and match our emotions to complement theirs.

Misunderstandings can arise from mixed signals, so we can be aware of what we're feeling and express it effectively. Without controlling out expressions, it's easy to have a discrepancy between the truth and what the other person sees.

To reduce misunderstandings in the first place, we should automatically explain ourselves and our decision-making. Making decisions quickly and independently may be efficient, but it's not effective. Another common culprit is a misalignment between intention and impact; we must think before we speak, making sure our impact will likely be what we intended.

Little details matter a lot over time, so it's good to make a habit of saying or doing small things. People do notice, and when we care, we must show it.

When we give feedback, make it direct, constructive, and targeted at the problem rather than the person. For the receiving end, feedback and critiques may be hard to hear, but taking it well and working on them makes a huge difference. This also means to control anger well, making sure to only use it when we intend to and when it will actually benefit the situation.

Similarly, in arguments, we must always keep in mind that the goal is to resolve the problem, not be in the right. It can help to reorient the argument by saying something neutral, like "this is hard," or asking how the other person is feeling. The point is to reopen communication and redirect our attention toward the problem, not each other.

Finally, tough conversations are inevitable. The following tips will help us navigate them more effectively.
1. Start with common ground.
2. Ask to understand the other person's perspective.
3. Listen carefully without thinking of rebuttals.
4. Explain our own perspective clearly and openly.
5. Move the conversation forward, trying to find agreement.
6. Check progress after the conversation; the resolution needs _more_ attention after it's decided.
