> A guide to achieving financial and psychological freedom.

# Summary
1. Money is a store of our life energy.
2. We can achieve psychological security by clearly monitoring financial movements and consciously spending our money.
3. By detaching our job from our identity, we're free to pursue fulfillment through other means.
4. Financial independence arises from covering expenses through capital (investments) rather than our job.

# Thoughts
Though the book is targeted more towards people who want to limit their expenses rather than those who wish to be more comfortable with spending (like me), its lessons are still extremely applicable and valuable.

Defining money in terms of life energy has helped me tremendously with recognizing its true value. I've been calculating my spending in terms of the number of hours I need to work for the price tag, and this redefinition, though similar, highlights the idea that money is something meant to be used. On its own, it has no value. It is only by converting it into something we deem worthwhile that we can truly make use of our life energy.

Reviewing my transactions, literally down to the cent, has significantly decreased my anxiety. I've realized that much of it stems from a lack of feeling in control rather than the actual decrease in wealth. Applying a budgeting system has helped me become a lot more comfortable with money.

Another important point the book makes is the disconnect between our job and our fulfillment. Though it's optimal for the two to coincide, they often don't. I've been searching for a job that gives me fulfillment and didn't even consider how the time I spend outside of it is much more valuable instead. It's so much easier to understand the thinking behind engineers at big tech and quants now. They chose that disconnect and, hopefully, found that their purpose can be achieved in their time off work.

Finally, the path toward financial independence has been extremely clarified. There is a real, crucial purpose to saving besides just having a safety net. Making our complete income from capital seems so obvious in hindsight.

This book has significantly clarified the role of money in our lives. It's helped me shape my priorities, change my mindset, and become more confident with future finances. I'm so glad I found it.

# Notes
For most people, money plays an unhealthy role in their lives. Though quality of life has gone up tremendously in the past decades, happiness has remained constant. Modern adult schedules consist of grinding away at work, recovering at nights and weekends, and repeating the cycle until retirement. We're encouraged to spend all the money we make on consumption, adhering to America's "more is better" propaganda.

Unfortunately, fulfillment and happiness does not grow with wealth. At a certain point, as wealth increases, fulfillment trends downward. Clutter accumulates. We pass the point of "enough" without realizing our fulfillment has stopped growing.

There are nine steps to reframe our financial mindset and future. Following them will help us achieve a healthier quality of life through honing our perception of value and optimizing our spending.

## Strictly review our current spending habits
Our initial goal is to understand our current spending habits. How much money have we earned so far? How much have we spent? What is our net worth?

When reviewing our past, it's important to stave off self-criticism. No shame, no blame. It's more important to be honest and accurate, and by remaining objective and truly understanding our behavior, we can begin to improve.

## Track our true wage and expenses to monitor the value of our life energy
What is money, really?

At its most fundamental level, it's a measure of objective value. From a more abstract point of view, people associate it with security, power, social acceptance, and evil. Our spending habits even reflect personalities and value sets.

But ultimately, money is something we trade our life energy for. It's not an external force but an extension of our life force, the only thing that really matters to us.

It's important to have a clear understanding of what we're trading our life energy for. Therefore, we must closely investigate our true hourly wage (our pay minus work expenses) and our every transaction, knowing that these movements are what we exchange our very lives for. "Keep track of every cent that comes into or goes out of your life."

## Review the spending of our life energy every month
Traditional budgets are ineffective. There's no use in restricting ourselves and making us suffer.

Instead, we must simply be conscious of our spending. Again, no shame, no blame. Categorizing and totaling our transactions helps us understand the reality of our situation.

With the costs we've organized, we can now calculate the hours of life energy we exchange for them. These are simple observations. In the next step, it's up to us to judge them.

## Access the fulfillment we gain from our expenditure of life energy
To find fulfillment, we first need to define our purpose, our dreams. What makes you feel fulfilled? What would you do if you didn't need to work? If you were going to die in a year, how would you spend your final days?

In short, purpose is something we would literally sacrifice our life for, something we would gladly dedicate our lives to.

With it in mind, we're ready to access our spending with the following questions.
1. Is the fulfillment I received proportional to the life energy expended?
2. Does this use of life energy agree with my values and purpose?
3. How would this expenditure change if I didn't have to work?

With our answers, we can determine whether expenditures for each category should go up or down. Now, it's much easier to see where we've been wastefully spending and where we've been foolishly penny-pinching. We can also clearly compare our expenses across categories, questioning whether we gave money to what we find truly important.

By analyzing our fulfillment in this way, we can move, month by month, toward the point of "enough," the peak of the fulfillment curve. At this point, there's no desired change in expenditure.

Psychologically and spiritually, this step is the heart of our financial journey. This is how we align money with the broader enjoyment of our lives.

## Plot monthly income and expenses to visualize our progress.
This chart simply displays our progress toward the peak of the fulfillment curve. It's important to be open about how we're doing, to review both our failures and successes. The plot is a tangible representation of our transformation.

## Spend life energy deliberately to increase fulfillment
Frugality is about decreasing spending without affecting pleasure, maximizing the use of our life energy on things that we genuinely care about, and making sure none of it goes to waste. In doing so, we not only refine our spending but also find enjoyment in knowing we got good value in exchange for our life.

## Detach spiritual needs from our job, find fulfillment in other work
Jobs are confused with our _being_ when they are, in actuality, what we are doing. Doing and being are entirely different things; we simply do our job, but are being is not defined by it. A easy mistake we make in modern society is defining our identity by our job.

We turn to our jobs to satisfy non-financial needs even though the sole core purpose of a job is to earn money. Other needs, like stimulation, growth, contribution, and meaning do not need to be tied to our employment. Breaking the link between paid employment and true work—activities sustaining our life purpose—is crucial to making the most of our time and finding fulfillment in our use of it.

What would you do if you didn't have to work for money?

Nevertheless, we should still pursue higher pay, simply because it means we meet our "enough" using less life energy. The main purpose of wealth should be to increase freedom and own more of our time.

## Invest savings to build interest for financial independence
Savings are capital that makes more money for you. By putting it, month after month, into speculation or debt instruments, we slowly build a stable income that can overtake our spending. At this crossover point, we achieve traditional financial independence with a secure income that's disconnected from our job.

We can shift our financial mindset by recognizing that our working years are limited. There is a strong argument to pursuing maximal income since after the crossover point, we're completely free to chase personal dreams.

Past this point, we can gain more fulfillment by working toward our purpose. The era of accumulation (reaching "enough") is over, and the era of giving (toward yourself, your loved ones, and the world) has begun.

## Intelligently manage long-term finances to balance risk and consistency
To invest, we should establish three sums: capital, the money that goes into investments and delivers income; cushion, a reserve enough to cover half a year of normal expenses (in case of emergency); and cache, additional savings serving as a psychological buffer ("and then some") that pays for unusually large purchases.

Treasury bonds provide a steady income since they're protected by the US government. They are used by the government to borrow money with the promise of paying it back, with interest, in the far future. US bonds are the safest investments we can make.

The stock market is riskier but provides, on average, higher returns. Index funds are generally favored as they passively mimic stock market indices; therefore, our money changes with the broader economy.
